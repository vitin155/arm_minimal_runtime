# Building ARM Firmware Without HAL and Stdlibs

Welcome to the "arm_minimal_runtime" repository, where we focus on building ARM firmware without the use of hardware abstraction layers (HAL), standard libraries, and instead use a custom linker script. If you're looking to dive into bare-metal programming on ARMv7-M architecture like the Cortex-M4 or Cortex-M4F, this educational project is perfect for you.

## Overview
In this repository, we strip away the complexities of traditional firmware development and embrace the simplicity of bare-metal programming. By eschewing HAL and standard libraries, we gain a deeper understanding of the underlying hardware and software interactions, making this project an excellent learning experience for those interested in low-level programming.
